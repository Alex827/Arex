Harddrives That Don't Mount on Addonics SATA Controllers

Using Addonics Red SATA controllers Model #: ADSA4R5

Hard Drive Model #: Seagate ST6000DM001

Issue: Seems like big hard drives like 6TB have issues being seen
	on computers that use the Addonics red SATA controllers. The controllers
	sees the hard drive in its BIOS menu but it would recognize it as an
	"Invalid Raid Device."
	
Fix: You have to go to the BIOS menu for the Addonics controller and delete the	
	RAID set. It shouldn't clear any data on the hard drive, but a back up would
	be best. It should then change the drive status from "Invalid Raid Device" to	
	"Reserved Drive"
